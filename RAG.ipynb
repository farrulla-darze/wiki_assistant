The new Brazilian Republic was riddled with corruption and nepotism, and eventually there was a civil war in 1893-5. Travelling naturalists were to be based in Rio de Janeiro, and instructions were sent out. Müller refused point-blank and was dismissed, as was von Ihering in São Paulo.\n",

      "In his retirement years Müller received many letters of support and offers of financial help (from Darwin, amongst others). His cousin Alfred Möller visited him, and eventually became his biographer. His rewards during life from the Brazilian state were minor; but his reputation now stands high. He was one of a half-dozen great naturalists to visit and work in South America during the nineteenth century. Humboldt, Darwin, Wallace, Bates, Spruce — and Fritz Müller. He was the only one of these to settle in Brazil for the rest of his life. A statue was erected to Müller in Blumenau in 1929.\n",

      "The Apollo program was a project by NASA to send humans to explore the Moon and bring them back to Earth safely. The program started in 1961 due to the Soviet Union's success in sending a person into outer space during the Cold War. The spacecraft used for the Apollo missions were made up of a Command and Service Module and a Lunar Module, which docked on the way to the Moon. The program consisted of several mission types, each testing specific parts and tasks, with the goal of landing a person on the Moon and returning them safely to Earth.\n",
      "Some conspiracy theories claim that the Apollo Moon landings were faked or hoaxed, but there is no credible evidence to support these claims. The rocks collected during the Apollo missions have been extensively studied by scientists around the world, and they are found to be very different from meteorites and other rocks found on Earth. In addition, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter was able to photograph the Apollo 14 landing site in 2009, clearly showing the base of the lunar module and the astronauts' footprints on the Moon's surface.\n",
      "NASA has addressed some of the conspiracy theories over the years, including releasing materials to refute hoax claims and canceling a book project by a former rocket scientist who was also a moon landing conspiracy theorist. In 2006, some recordings of the Apollo era were declared missing, leading to speculation among conspiracy theorists that they had been erased. However, NASA later revealed that the tapes had been erased due to a mistake.\n",
      "Overall, while there are some conspiracy theories surrounding the Apollo Moon landings, there is no credible evidence to support these claims, and the overwhelming scientific consensus is that the Moon landings did in fact occur."
