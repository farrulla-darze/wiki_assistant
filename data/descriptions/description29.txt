The image features a person using a tape measure to gauge the diameter of a large cylindrical object, perhaps a pipe or drum. The tape measure is extended across the curvature of the cylinder, and the person's hand, wearing a white glove, is holding the end of the tape measure. A piece of the cylinder, the hand with the tape measure, and a dark background compose the majority of the image. The specifics of what the cylinder is used for or its materials cannot be determined from this image alone.
