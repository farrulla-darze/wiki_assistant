The image displays an analog pressure gauge. The scale on the gauge is graduated in both MPa and kgf/cm2 units, indicative of it measuring pressure. The needle is pointing slightly above 1.5 MPa, which would be approximately 15.3 kgf/cm2, considering the scale visible.

There is a label on the gauge with a serial number or identification code which is not entirely clear due to the resolution of the image, but it includes alphanumeric characters that appear to be "J994" followed by potentially more characters or numbers. If this gauge is part of a regular inspection routine, the serial number would be critical for tracking the gauge's calibration, maintenance, and performance over time.

No additional context is provided about the specific machinery this gauge is attached to, but given the industrial setting of valve manufacturing as mentioned, this pressure gauge is likely used to monitor the pressure within a system, such as a test rig for the valves being produced, to ensure they operate within specified pressure ranges.
