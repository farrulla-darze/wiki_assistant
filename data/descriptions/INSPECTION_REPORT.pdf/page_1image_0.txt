The image you've provided seems to be a logo rather than an inspection image related to a valve manufacturing setting. It shows a stylized depiction of a bird in red, with a blue and red design underneath spelling "J-PEC". The logo also includes a registered trademark symbol (®) on the top right. This logo might be associated with the company in question but doesn't give any further detail on the manufacturing process or the equipment. If you have any specific images of the equipment, sensors, or valves, I can analyze those for you instead.
