It appears that there has been some misunderstanding. The image you've provided is not clear, and it doesn't seem to depict a valve manufacturing setting, identifiable machinery, equipment, or tools. There are no captions, text, or sensor readings visible. It looks more like an abstract or heavily blurred image that does not provide any useful information for analysis within the context you've described. If you have another image that aligns better with the inspection report you mentioned, please provide it, and I'd be happy to assist with analysis.
