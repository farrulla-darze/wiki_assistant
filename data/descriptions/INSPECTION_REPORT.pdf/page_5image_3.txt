The image shows what appears to be a quality control or inspection process taking place within an industrial setting, probably relating to valve manufacturing as per your description. Specifically, we can see a large metal (likely steel) object with a person using a measuring tape to take a dimension. The measuring tape, an elementary but essential tool in manufacturing for ensuring parts are within specified tolerances, is extended across a curved surface which might be part of a valve or a pipe.

Unfortunately, the image does not show the reading on the tape measure clearly due to the perspective and resolution. There's also a lack of visible captions, text, or sensor readings in the image. The person in the image appears to be wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) including a white glove and a blue hard hat, indicating adherence to safety protocols. No machinery or equipment besides the measuring tape is visible in this frame.
