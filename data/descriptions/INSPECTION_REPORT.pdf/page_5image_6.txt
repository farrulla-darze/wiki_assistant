The image shows a handheld device with a digital display being used to take a measurement on an industrial component, which seems to be a part of a valve, given the context of valve manufacturing. This device appears to be a type of gauge or sensor, commonly used in industrial settings for inspecting or measuring parameters such as temperature, pressure, thickness, or other variables on machinery or components.

The display on the device reads "31.7°C," which indicates that the person is measuring the temperature of the component. From the setting and given information, it's likely that this is a routine temperature check to ensure that the valve is operating within the acceptable temperature range, maintaining the quality and safety standards of the manufacturing process.

Unfortunately, due to the low resolution and angle of the photo, specific details about the device model or any other text that may be present on the device's body or display are not discernible.
