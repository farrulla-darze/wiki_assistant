The image depicts a handheld device that appears to be a portable ultrasonic testing (UT) machine used for non-destructive testing (NDT) of materials. This equipment is typically used to test the integrity of materials such as metal pipes or structures without causing any damage. The device includes a screen, which seems to display the results of the test or settings, and a keypad for inputting commands or navigating the device's menu.

The screen display is not clear in the image, making it impossible to provide any sensor readings or information displayed. A cable can be seen running from the device towards what looks like a metal pipe or cylinder, suggesting that an ultrasonic probe may be connected to the device to perform the testing.

Given the context of valve manufacturing, the ultrasonic testing could be part of a quality control process to ensure the pipes or components being manufactured meet the required thickness, density, and absence of flaws such as cracks or inclusions. However, due to the image's resolution and angle, I cannot provide exact details about the measurements or the specific model of the device.
