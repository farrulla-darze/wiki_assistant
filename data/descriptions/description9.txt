The image depicts an analog pressure gauge, typically used to measure the pressure of a fluid (gas or liquid) within a system. The gauge face includes a scale that is marked with units of pressure measurement, in this case, "MPa" which stands for megapascals. The needle points to the current pressure level. Below the scale, there is a small plate with a number, likely indicating a model number, serial number, or calibration information. The gauge appears to be mounted on a wall or some other flat surface, evidenced by the four screws at the border of the gauge.
