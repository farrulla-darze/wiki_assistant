This image shows two people working on a large industrial valve connected to a pipeline system. The valve has a large red handwheel, which is used to manually open or close the valve to control the flow of a substance through the pipe. The people are dressed in blue work overalls, suggesting they might be maintenance workers, technicians, or engineers. They both appear to be engaged in some sort of maintenance, inspection, or operational task involving the valve. The environment looks like an industrial or mechanical setting, often associated with facilities like power plants, factories, refineries, or other places where large-scale piping and valve systems are common.
