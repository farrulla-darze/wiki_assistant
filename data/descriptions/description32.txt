This image shows a handheld device with a digital display being held in a person's hand. The display of the device is showing a numerical value, which appears to be "31.7°" — presumably indicating a temperature reading in degrees Celsius. This is likely a digital thermometer used for measuring the temperature of a surface or the ambient air. The background is slightly out of focus, but it seems to be an indoor setting with a corner of a wall or an object with a curved edge.
