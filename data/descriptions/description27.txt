The image you provided is blurry and it's difficult to identify the specific details accurately. However, it appears to show a surface that may be wrapped in some type of reflective material, possibly plastic wrap or a metallic foil. The reflection of light on the surface creates bright streaks that suggest the material is somewhat shiny or glossy. If you require a more detailed analysis, I would need a clearer picture or more context about the object in question.
