The image shows a handheld device being operated by a person. The device appears to be a piece of industrial or scientific equipment, possibly a measuring instrument, such as an ultrasonic thickness gauge or a similar diagnostic tool used for non-destructive testing of materials. The device has a numerical keypad, a few function buttons, and a small display screen. It is connected by a cable to a probe or sensor, which seems to be placed on a pipe or cylindrical metal object, indicating that the device is likely used to measure the characteristics of the pipe or material, such as its thickness or integrity.
