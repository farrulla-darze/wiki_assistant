This image shows a person using a digital multimeter to measure either voltage, current, or resistance on a piece of machinery. The equipment appears to be part of an industrial or mechanical setting, given the metallic piping and machinery components visible. The multimeterâ€™s display reads "000," which indicates that the measurement being taken is not registering a value that is within the meter's range or there is no current, voltage, or resistance at the test points, depending on the context. The image also has overlay text, likely added post-capture, that includes "DATA," "TIME," "DEPTH," and "X" and "Y" coordinates, which suggests this might be for documentation or monitoring purposes within a technical or engineering environment. The blurring and text suggest it's designed to simulate a display from a piece of technical equipment, possibly for a training scenario or equipment demonstration.
