The image shows a circular gauge with a dial and numbers around the edge. The gauge appears to be an analog meter commonly used to measure pressure, temperature, or another variable physical property. The specific scale and units are not entirely visible; however, the needle points to a value slightly above 0, suggesting that whatever is being measured is at or near its lower limit. The background offers limited context but suggests the gauge is mounted on a panel which could be part of machinery or industrial equipment.
