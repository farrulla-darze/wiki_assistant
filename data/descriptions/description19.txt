The image appears to have a company logo that consists of stylized text and an abstract bird-like symbol. The text reads "JPECO" with a particular emphasis on the "ECO" part, possibly to highlight an environmentally friendly or ecological aspect of the company. The bird symbol is red and seems to be designed to represent speed or agility, often associated with companies that value fast service or dynamic operations. Additionally, there is a small registered trademark symbol (Â®) at the top right, indicating that the logo is a registered trademark.
