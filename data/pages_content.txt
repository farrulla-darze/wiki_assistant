 Details of inspection activities carried out with respect to scope of work
1. Witness pressure testing
J-PECO inspector witnessed pressure testing for the 5 sets of valve according to API 6D
standards. The details were as following table:
No Strength test Water seal test Air seal test DBB water test DBB air test Results
1 38MPa/15min 27.5MPa/5min 0.6MPa/5min 27.5MPa/5min 0.6MPa/5min Acc.
2 38MPa/15min 27.5MPa/5min 0.6MPa/5min 27.5MPa/5min 0.6MPa/5min Acc.
The pressure testing was acceptable. Please refer to process pictures:

2. Witness torque testing
KCON tested the torque values for the 5 sets of valve. J-PECO inspector witnessed total
process, and checked the torque values, which met drawing’s requirement.
KCON tested the torque value for item1 (PNEUMATIC ACTUATOR) with special test tool.

Overview of test torque for item1 Testing process
KCON tested the torque value for item2 (GEAR OPERATOR, 4 sets) with torque spanner.
Please see following pictures:
Overview of test torque for item2 Testing values
3. Witness Function test
Because the PNEUMATIC ACTUATOR didn’t arrive at KCON site (buy it from aboard). So,
KCON did the function test with gear box (it’s same with itme2).
J-PECO inspector witnessed the function process, and run the wheel, it’s smooth. Accepted.

multimeter (12V). Required value is less than 10ohm. Actual values are about 0.4ohm, which
met standard’s requirements.
